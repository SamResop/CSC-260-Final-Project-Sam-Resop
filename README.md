# CSC-260-Final-Project

I am creating a fighting game in Unity for my Object Oriented Design final project. This ReadMe will contain an update log on my project.

For uploads, I will be uploading an exported version of the game, along with the scripts I wrote

  - Controls: Both players can be controlled via the keyboard. WASD/the arrow keys will move player 1 and ijkl will move player 2
    - Attack Controls: Player 1 can perform heavy and light attacks with the left alt and control buttons, and Player 2 can perform heavy and light attacks with the o and u keys
    - Movement: Both players can move, attack, jump, crouch, and block
    - Both players can be hit and take damage
    - Both players walk past each other.

    - Players can jump through each other and cause hit detection
    - Players can sometimes jump into each other and break the controls
    - Hit detection lasts for too long on attacks
